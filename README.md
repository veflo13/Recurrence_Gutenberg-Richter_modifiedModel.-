# Recurrence_Gutenberg-Richter_modifiedModel.-
Recurrence_Gutenberg-Richter_modifiedModel. Calculated for Peru and based on the work of Gamarra and Aguilar (2009) Castillo and Alva (1993a,b).  Objective: to improve the input of data from the sources and visualize the recurrence in a single graph.

# Next steps 
You have two duplicate files, one where you can visualize the recurrence of all sources in a single graph and the other where you can visualize source by source. 
a) add a button to the user's preference. 
b) add options to change seismic sources and geographic coordinates. 
c) add a button to alter the recurrence according to the zone or study desired.
